# Chronicle

A microservice based bookkeeping / personal finance application to learn how to integrate Docker, Postgres, K8s, Ruby, Python, and AI services.

## Requirements

- Soft API dependencies.  APIs should not directly call other APIs.  Use a message broker, aggregation container, or similar.  Keep APIs independent of each other for better alerting and tracability.
